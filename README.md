## ScrollSript

#### The .ahk file can be modified by any text editor but should be compiled with the usage of [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com)

#### The .exe file is the working program. Holding one of the mouse's side buttons will scroll in the appropriate direction, double-clicking and holding will scroll much faster.
